# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Insights-Visualization-using-Hidden-Markov-Models
### Overview ###
Customer churn is a significant challenge faced by businesses in the telecom industry and various
other industries as well. The term “churn” refers to the loss of customers, either due to dissatisfaction
with services, availability of better alternatives, or other external factors.
The high cost of acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones has made churn
prediction and management a critical area of focus for companies. As Predicting churn allows
businesses to implement strategies to retain customers, enhance satisfaction, and maintain
profitability.
In today’s data-driven world, businesses generate huge amounts of customer-related data. This data
contains valuable insights that can be leveraged to understand customer behavior and predict
potential customers who would churn and focus efforts into retaining them.
Advanced machine learning models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), provide an effective
way to analyze sequential data and uncover patterns and factors that lead to the churn of customers.
This chapter introduces the project, its objectives, and the motivation behind employing machine
learning techniques for churn prediction.
